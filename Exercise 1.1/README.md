# üöÄ Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python üêç

This document outlines the steps taken and deliverables created for Exercise 1.1 of the Intro to Python course. The goal of this exercise was to set up the Python development environment, understand virtual environments, manage packages, and get acquainted with basic scripting and version control with Git.

## üìù Steps Completed:

1.  **‚úÖ Python Installation & Version Check:**
    *   Verified the Python installation on the system.
    *   Confirmed version (initially Python 3.12.3, proceeding with this version).
    *   _(Screenshot: `Exercise 1.1/Deliverables/Step 1.png`)_

2.  **‚öôÔ∏è Virtual Environment Setup:**
    *   Initially created a virtual environment named `cf-python-base` using `python -m venv cf-python-base`.
    *   Successfully activated the environment.
    *   (Note: For the cloned project, a new environment like `.venv` can be created within the project root and used.)
    *   _(Screenshot: `Exercise 1.1/Deliverables/Step 2.png`)_

3.  **üíª First Python Script (`add.py`):**
    *   Installed and set up Visual Studio Code as the primary text editor.
    *   Created a Python script `add.py` that:
        *   Takes two numbers as input from the user.
        *   Calculates their sum.
        *   Prints the result to the console.
    *   _(Code: `Exercise 1.1/add.py`)_
    *   _(Screenshots: `Exercise 1.1/Deliverables/Step 3-1.png`, `Exercise 1.1/Deliverables/Step 3-2.png`)_

4.  **‚ú® IPython Shell Setup:**
    *   Installed the `ipython` package using `pip install ipython` within an active virtual environment.
    *   Launched the IPython shell to verify the installation and explore its features.
    *   _(Screenshot: `Exercise 1.1/Deliverables/Step 4.png`)_

5.  **üì¶ Package Management (`requirements.txt`):**
    *   Generated a `requirements.txt` file from an active environment using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
    *   Demonstrated the principle of replicating an environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   _(File: `Exercise 1.1/requirements.txt`)_
    *   _(Screenshots: `Exercise 1.1/Deliverables/Step 5-1.png`, `Exercise 1.1/Deliverables/Step 5-2.png`)_

6.  **‚òÅÔ∏è GitHub Repository Setup:**
    *   Created a new public GitHub repository named `cf-intro-to-python` (or your chosen name).
    *   Created an `Exercise 1.1` folder within the repository to house all deliverables for this exercise.
    *   Cloned the repository to the local machine.
    *   Organized project files (`add.py`, `requirements.txt`, this README, and other deliverables) within the `Exercise 1.1` folder in the cloned repository.
    *   _(Screenshots documenting GitHub setup are in the `Exercise 1.1/Deliverables/` folder)_

## üìÅ Deliverables

All deliverables for this exercise are located within this `Exercise 1.1` folder and its `Deliverables` subfolder:
*   This `README.md` file (located directly in `Exercise 1.1/`).
*   The `add.py` script (located directly in `Exercise 1.1/`).
*   The `requirements.txt` file (located directly in `Exercise 1.1/`).
*   The `Deliverables/` subfolder containing:
    *   `python-for-web-developers-learning-journal.docx` (or your journal file name).
    *   All screenshots documenting each step (e.g., `Step 1.png`, `Step 2.png`, etc.).
